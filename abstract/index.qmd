### The Researcher

**Me!**  

I am Gregorio Maya, **City Science Coordinator** at the [Norman Foster Institute](https://normanfosterinstitute.org/) and a freelance consultant for various NGOs. My focus lies in **data-driven analysis of urban environments**, particularly through applied research in **technology integration** within public policy for urban planning. Trained as an architect with a _Summa Cum Laude_ degree, I have transitioned from traditional design to consulting on modeling complex systems within the built environment.

In my current role, I co-lecture in Urban Analytics and lead the technical development of sustainability tools for cities. My recent work includes collaborating with municipalities to shape and implement **Climate Action Plans (CAP)**, aligning urban growth with climate resilience. In a nutshell, I contribute to developing solutions that integrate **data science, urban design, and sustainability**.

In parallel, I consult for NGOs, providing data insights and visualizations that support **impactful development** across various sectors.

I maintain academic ties with my _alma maters_, [The Bartlett-UCL](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/bartlett/architecture/bartlett-school-architecture) (UK) and [Universidad de los Andes](https://arqdis.uniandes.edu.co/) (COL), and collaborate closely with professors at [MIT - Media Lab](https://www.media.mit.edu/) (USA), [UAM](https://www.uam.es/uam/en/inicio) (ES), and [UCA Canterbury](https://www.uca.ac.uk/study/subject/architecture/) (UK), among many others.

## The Research Topic

### Main Focus
"The challenges of implementing health outcomes as drivers of urban development."

### Why It Matters
- Address societal and commercial value for Ramboll/BUPA.
- Align with global trends like sustainability and public health.

### Sub-Sections
#### Context  
- **Frameworks:**  
  - SDGs: List the relevant ones (e.g., SDG 3 and SDG 11).
  - Other urban policies as relevant.

#### The Problem(s)
1. **Narrative mismatch:** Challenges at the intersection of two disciplines.  
2. **Untracked urban development:** Lack of rigorous long-term tracking methodologies.  
3. **Lack of technical skill:** Urbanists often lack training in certain techniques.
