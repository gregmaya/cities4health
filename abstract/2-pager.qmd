**Deadline:** 2 September 2025 · **Start:** Jan 2026 (full‑time) — early partial availability possible

## Summary

A transport‑first Industry PhD embedding **health outcomes** into Ramboll’s active travel, micromobility and accessibility work. The project will turn **validated links** between transport determinants and health into **spatial indicators**, a **decision‑support prototype**, and a **preventive‑health valuation lens** that helps Ramboll win and deliver projects.


### Why this matters for Transport

- Position health as a **commercial enabler** for bids and delivery, not just a co‑benefit.
- Equip teams with **diagnostics** (where health gains are highest) and **what‑if** tools (how network and street changes shift risk and benefits).
- Aligns with past RAMBOLL UK work: [Neighbourhood Futures and Smart Mobility](https://www.ramboll.com/en-gb/news/ramboll-and-impact-on-urban-health-launch-the-neighbourhood-futures-framework).

## The ask

::: {.warning}
- **Host the Industry PhD** within Ramboll Transport and integrate it with ongoing projects.
- **Funding structure:** **50%** Innovation Fund Denmark · **25%** Ramboll Transport (host) · **25%** Ramboll Foundation (TBC).
- IP stays **in‑house** with Ramboll; KU may publish client‑approved use cases.
:::

## Goals & how this will complement Ramboll Transport

**Goals**

- **Prioritise active travel**, micromobility and accessibility with clear, measurable health outcomes.
- Map and reduce **heat‑island** exposure along key pedestrian and cycle journeys.
- Create a **long term product**: Health Impact Assessments (HIA) with mobility at its core. 


{{< pagebreak >}}

**What will this add to the department**

- **Decision‑support prototype** – quick diagnostics and simple “what‑if” scenarios for routes, networks and schemes.
- **Spatial indicator pack** – walk/cycle accessibility, shaded‑route quality & heat exposure, crash‑risk surfaces, air‑quality exposure, access to health/amenities.
- **Preventive‑health valuation note** – convert mode shift and exposure reductions into indicative avoided health burden for business cases.

These deliverables plug directly into live work such as: **Active Travel Action Plans**, **heat‑island exposure on pedestrian journeys**, and **air‑quality risk assessments for major schemes**.

## Pilot pathway (_suggestion_)

Start by plugging into **current commissions** to create quick wins and case studies, then formalise as **Health Outcomes for Transport** capability.
