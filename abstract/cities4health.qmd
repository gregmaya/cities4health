**Greg Maya**  

> City Science Coordinator, Norman Foster Institute (NFI)
> Freelance data consultant for various NGOs 

<div style="font-size: smaller;">
My focus lies in data-driven analysis of urban environments, particularly through applied research in health and technology integration in urban planning design and policy. Trained as an architect with a Summa Cum Laude degree and a MSC in Space Syntax,I have transitioned from traditional design to consulting on modeling complex systems within the built environment.</div>

## Context  {background-image="images/ped_level2.png"}

::: {.fragment .fade-up}
Urban environments play a crucial role in shaping health outcomes, particularly in addressing non-communicable diseases (NCDs). **This research is aimes at positioning urban planning as a proactive health intervention, capable of reducing healthcare burdens and enhancing overall quality of life.**
:::
::: {.fragment .fade-up}
Despite strong evidence linking urban design and public health, current planning frameworks often neglect these considerations. **There is an opportunity to bridge that gap by systematically translating health outcomes into actionable spatial decisions and integrating them within the current policy frameworks**. It will explore methodologies for new design tools that orient urban and transport planners into health positive outcomes and quantifying the economic advantages of said approaches.
:::
::: {.fragment .fade-up}
<mark>The study seeks to provide decision-support tools and strategic insights for city designers, authorities and other stakeholders.</mark> Aligning planning with public health objectives should contribute to creating more liveable, resilient, and equitable cities.

## Problem Statement {background-image="images/ped_level2.png"}

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="48%"}
::: {.incremental}
- Non Communicable Deseases (NCDs) are responsible for +70% of deaths (WHO, 2024).
- European cities getting older, hence, more prone to suffering from an increase in NCDs.
- Urban health issues are linked to poor spatial planning, pollution, and sedentary lifestyles.
- Lack of actionable indicators that could lead to design decisions with better health outcomes. 
:::
:::

::: {.column width="48%"}
::: {.incremental}
- Inadequate integration of health considerations in urban planning practices and transport sectors.
- Lack of awareness on the long-term economic costs of designs that do not incorporate a minimum standard for health outcomes. 
- Failing to leverage the built environment as a preventative health opportunity.

## Opportunity {background="#282a36"}

<br>

<br>

::: {.fragment .fade-up}
### Capture the growing demand for healthier, sustainable urban environments acknoledged by the general public and reflected by policy.

## Solution Overview {background="#2a303c"}

Introducing a data-driven urban planning model to enhance urban health outcomes.  
Uncovering the most direct links from <mark style="background-color: #a5a7ad; color: white;">Urban Determinants</mark> to <mark style="background-color: #d5a6bd; color: white;">Health Outcomes</mark> (NCDs).

:::{.fragment .fade-up}
<img src="images/urb_det4.png" alt="Urban Determinants" style="width:100%; height:auto;">

The model should have the potential to benefit from _'easy wins'_ but also to develop complexity and robustness over time.
