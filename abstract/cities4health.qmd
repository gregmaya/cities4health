**Greg Maya**

> City Science Coordinator, Norman Foster Institute (NFI) Freelance data consultant for various NGOs

::: {style="font-size: smaller;"}
My focus lies in data-driven analysis of urban environments, particularly through applied research in health and technology integration in urban planning design and policy. Trained as an architect with a Summa Cum Laude degree and a MSC in Space Syntax,I have transitioned from traditional design to consulting on modeling complex systems within the built environment.

## Context {background-image="images/ped_level2.png"}

::: {.fragment .fade-up}
Urban environments play a crucial role in shaping health outcomes, particularly in addressing non-communicable diseases (NCDs). **This research is aimed at positioning urban planning as a proactive health intervention, capable of reducing healthcare burdens and enhancing overall quality of life.**
:::

::: {.fragment .fade-up}
Despite strong evidence linking urban design and public health, current planning frameworks often neglect these considerations. **There is an opportunity to bridge that gap by systematically translating health outcomes into actionable spatial decisions and integrating them within the current policy and design frameworks**. It will explore methodologies for new design tools that orient urban and transport planners into health positive outcomes and quantifying the economic advantages of said approaches.
:::

::: {.fragment .fade-up}
<mark>The study seeks to provide decision-support tools and strategic insights for city designers, authorities and other stakeholders.</mark> Aligning planning with public health objectives should contribute to creating more liveable, resilient, and equitable cities.
:::

## Problem Statement {background-image="images/ped_level2.png"}

::::::: columns
:::: {.column width="48%"}
::: incremental
-   Non Communicable Deseases (NCDs) are responsible for +70% of deaths (WHO, 2024).
-   European cities getting older, hence, more prone to suffering from an increase in NCDs.
-   Urban health issues are linked to poor spatial planning, pollution, and sedentary lifestyles.
-   Lack of actionable indicators that could lead to design decisions with better health outcomes.
:::
::::

:::: {.column width="48%"}
::: incremental
-   Inadequate integration of health considerations in urban planning practices and transport sectors.
-   Lack of awareness on the long-term economic costs of designs that do not incorporate a minimum standard for health outcomes.
-   Failing to leverage the built environment as a preventative health opportunity.

:::
:::

::: {.fragment .fade-up}
### **International Development Opportunities**

::: {style="font-size: smaller;"}
Major development projects increasingly require health impact considerations:

- **Georgian Sustainable Urban Mobility Project** (2022) specifically sought consultants to align transport modes with climate protection goals and contribute to "better living conditions for the population"[^15]
- **Peru's Urban Passenger Transportation Service** (2025) improvement projects include health and environmental considerations as core requirements[^16]
:::
:::

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Strategic Implementation Framework

<br>

::: {.fragment .fade-up}
### **Building Internal Capabilities**

Establish a dedicated **Health Outcomes Research Unit** within the transport division, similar to successful models at ARUP and WSP. This unit would:

- Develop proprietary health impact assessment methodologies for transport projects
- Create quantitative tools linking transport interventions to health outcomes
- Build partnerships with public health institutions and research organizations
- Train existing transport planners in health impact evaluation techniques
