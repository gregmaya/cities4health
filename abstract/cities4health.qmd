### Researcher
:::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="70%"}
**Greg Maya**  
City Science Coordinator at the Norman Foster Institute (NFI),  
Freelance data consultant for various NGOs 

My focus lies in data-driven analysis of urban environments, particularly through **applied research in health and technology integration** in urban planning design and policy. Trained as an architect with a Summa Cum Laude degree and a MSC in Space Syntax,I have transitioned from traditional design to consulting on modeling complex systems within the built environment.

## Context  {background-image="images/ped_level2.png"}

::: {.fragment .fade-up}
Urban environments play a crucial role in shaping health outcomes, particularly in addressing non-communicable diseases (NCDs). **This research is aimes at positioning urban planning as a proactive health intervention, capable of reducing healthcare burdens and enhancing overall quality of life.**
:::
::: {.fragment .fade-up}
Despite strong evidence linking urban design and public health, current planning frameworks often neglect these considerations. **There is an opportunity to bridge that gap by systematically translating health outcomes into actionable spatial decisions and integrating them within the current policy frameworks**. It will explore methodologies for new design tools that orient urban and transport planners into health positive outcomes and quantifying the economic advantages of said approaches.
:::

<mark>The study seeks to provide decision-support tools and strategic insights for city designers, authorities and other stakeholders.</mark> Aligning planning with public health objectives should contribute to creating more liveable, resilient, and equitable cities.

## Problem Statement {background-image="images/ped_level2.png"}

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="48%"}
::: {.incremental}
- Non Communicable Deseases (NCDs) are responsible for +70% of deaths (WHO, 2024).
- European cities getting older, hence, more prone to suffering from an increase in NCDs.
- Urban health issues are linked to poor spatial planning, pollution, and sedentary lifestyles.
- Lack of actionable indicators that could lead to design decisions with better health outcomes. 
:::
:::

::: {.column width="48%"}
::: {.incremental}
- Inadequate integration of health considerations in urban planning practices and transport sectors.
- Lack of awareness on the long-term economic costs of designs that do not incorporate a minimum standard for health outcomes. 
- Failing to leverage the built environment as a preventative health opportunity.

## Opportunity {background="#282a36"}

<br>

<br>

::: {.fragment .fade-up}
### Capture the growing demand for healthier, sustainable urban environments acknoledged by the general public and reflected by policy.

## Solution Overview {background="#2a303c" .scrollable}

### Introducing a data-driven urban planning model to enhance urban health outcomes.

Starting with the most direct links from <mark>Urban Determinants</mark> to <mark>Health Outcomes</mark> (NCDs).

<img src="images/urb_det.png" alt="Urban Determinants" style="width:100%; height:auto;">

The model should have the potential to benefit from `easy wins` but also to devlop complexity and robustness over time.

## Research Objectives and Key Questions {background-image="images/ped_level2.png"}

#### Objective
### To explore the commercial viability of integrating health outcomes in urban planning.

<br>

#### Key Research Questions:

<div style="text-align: center; font-weight: bold;">
Can urban planning strategies mitigate the impact of non-communicable diseases (NCDs) through behavioural and environmental changes?
</div>

::: {.columns}
::: {.column}
::: incremental
<div style="font-size: smaller;">
- What are the urban determinants of Health that affect most positively and negatively NCDs in case study cities?
- How can decision-support tools be designed to assist urban designers in aligning urban planning with public health objectives?
</div>

:::
:::

::: {.column}
::: incremental

<div style="font-size: smaller;">
- What are the quantifiable economic advantages of prioritizing health-centric urban design?
- What role do spatial accessibility and inequality play in determining health outcomes?
</div>

## Commercial Opportunity {.scrollable}

- Growing market demand for health-centric urban development.
- Potential to expand the portfolio into health impact consulting and data-driven urban planning.
- Strategic alignment with sustainable, smart city, transport and place-making projects.
- City-wide models that could identify areas of particular interest for urban intervention on the basis of health inequalities.
- **Revenue Streams:** urban analytics tools, models for active travel assessments that acknowledge health as additional outcomes. Future Health impact assessments (HIA)
- **Industry Trend:** Increasing regulatory requirements for health implications as part of different departmental outcomes. "Health as a transversal lens to siloed planning thinking"

### Potential for future commercial streams
Integration of health impact assessments (HIA) into urban planning, active transport projects and/or 


### Competitive Advantage and Differentiation

- Leverage advanced data analytics and urban modeling for evidence-based planning with a purpose: HEALTH.
- Integration of cross-sectoral knowledge (public health, urban planning, sustainability).
- First-mover advantage in health-centric urban consulting.
- Collaboration with leading academic institutions and access to cutting-edge research.

## Reference Case Study 1
### Barcelona Superblock Model

::: {.columns}
::: {.column}
<img src="images/barcelona_1.jpg" alt="Barcelona Superblock" style="width:90%; height:auto;">

> Transformation of urban blocks to reduce car dependency, increase green spaces, and promote active transport.
:::

::: {.column}
**Impact:**  

- 667 preventable deaths annually from improved air quality, noise reduction, and increased physical activity.
- Economic impact of €1.7 billion annually from health benefits.
<br>

**Relevance:** 

Demonstrates the commercial and societal value of integrating health in urban design.
