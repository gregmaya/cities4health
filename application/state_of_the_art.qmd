### State-of-the-art and theoretical background  
State-of-the-art and, if relevant, theoretical background for the Industrial PhD project’s field of research

Here, please describe the current state of the Industrial PhD project's specific research field: **How far has the research advanced, which barriers and openings have been encountered, what is known, and what is not known?** Refer to research literature in the description.

This section must describe where the research field is right now and is the reference point for the project objectives. If the field is unexplored, adjacent fields should be described.

Title:
State-of-the-Art in Health-Driven Urban Adaptation in Europe: Integrating System Science, Complex Adaptive Models, and Sectoral Adaptation Plans (SOAPS)

1. Introduction & Context

Briefly describe the urgent need to reorient urban development towards improved public health and climate resilience in Europe.
Mention the relevance of the European Green Deal, EU Adaptation Strategy, and Sustainable Development Goals (SDG 3 & 11).
Introduce the emerging concept of SOAPS as a policy tool for integrating health and adaptation objectives across sectors.

2. Theoretical Foundations

System Science & Complex Adaptive Models:
Define system science as the study of interdependent, dynamic systems where feedback loops and emergent properties are key.
Explain complex adaptive models as frameworks that capture how urban environments adapt through decentralized, interacting agents (e.g., planners, citizens, health services).
Emphasize that these models allow for non-linear, emergent outcomes that traditional linear approaches often overlook.

3. Policy and Regulatory Environment in Europe

Outline the evolution of EU policy instruments—from the 2013 EU Adaptation Strategy to recent directives and guidelines—highlighting the shift towards mainstreaming adaptation into sector-specific policies (e.g., water, transport, public health).
Discuss when and how SOAPS started being integrated into national/regional frameworks (e.g., statutory requirements emerging in some Member States from around 2015).
Briefly mention key EU documents and reports (e.g., EEA reports, European Commission guidelines).

4. Opportunities & Benefits of Sectoral Adaptation Plans (SOAPS)

Enhanced Urban Resilience:
Improved targeted measures (e.g., flood defenses, green infrastructure) that reduce climate risks and yield co-benefits such as lower urban heat and better air quality.
Economic & Health Co-Benefits:
Reduced healthcare costs, increased productivity, and improved property values linked to health-positive urban interventions.
Integrated Policy Synergies:
Better coordination among disparate sectors (urban planning, health, transport) through horizontal governance, leading to more coherent and effective adaptation strategies.

5. Research Implications for a PhD

Position system science and complex adaptive models as innovative methodologies to analyze and predict urban dynamics and health outcomes.
Highlight the potential for developing decision-support tools (e.g., urban health impact assessments) that can guide both policy and industry practice.
Emphasize the interdisciplinary nature and real-world applicability of this research, making it a fertile area for high-impact academic work.
Conclusion

Summarize the state-of-the-art in integrating health outcomes into urban planning through SOAPS and adaptive systems models, noting their promise for future research and practical impact in European cities.
